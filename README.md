# BikeShareCompany_Analytics_CaseStudy1

This case study was provided through the Google Data Analytics Course

This repository contains a case study that focuses on a company's bike share data. The analysis aims to uncover the different biking habits of annual and casual members across frequency of rides and duration of rides. The goal of this analysis is to use these findings to help create a strategy that will help the company convert casual members to annual members.

The Raw_BikeShare_Data contains the raw data files of 1 year of this company's ridership data which I analyzed.

bike_share_data_analysis_final.R is the R file where I analyzed and visualized the data.

Presentation.pptx is my powerpoint file that I put together with my data visualizations and insights with some proposed conversion strategies for the casual members to annual members. The speaker notes are included in the file.
